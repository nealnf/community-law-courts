title: "Community Law Courts"

We have legal knowledge so we can apply our knowledge of lawful and legal to assist any man or woman who finds themselves entangled at legalise courts i.e. magistrates, crown, county, family, court of protection.

In the very near future any man or woman ought to have the right to transfer any case that has been made against them at the legalise courts to community law courts.  Even before that happens we can disqualify paperwork and we have put in counterclaims for any perceived loss, harm or injury claims.

For the community law courts is natural law.  How we comprehend it is the law of now time because the law is created by the trial by jury.  For there are no judges in our court.  There is no judicator.  Someone like ourselves who can assist a trial by jury to comprehend things they may be struggling with.  For a trial by jury make all of the decisions and for the trial by jury uphold the orders put forward by the claimant or not.

At the moment there are precedence.  Precedence is like case law for example we are doing a class law on council tax where the findings of that court and whether those findings are upheld by the trial by jury probably will be able to be used at any court, legal or our courts in the future.  Certainly for six months or even after sixteen months but then after that we would probably have to have another trial by jury because society is constantly in a state of change and we can’t second guess what those people might decide in the future and how different that might be from what they decide now. 

### Enforcement

Enforcement is critical.  It is very important that people’s claims are enforced and that is something we have struggled with.  Firstly because we have been challenged by the legalise system itself who would very much like to keep us out for as long as possible.  Secondly we simply haven’t had Justices Of The Peace to assist us to enforce our orders and so we have been carrying out a public enforcement strategy which involves community taking action against any organisation that has been found in criminal or causing harm, loss or injury.

Our aim would be eventually that Justices Of The Peace can enforce our orders exactly the same way legalese courts would have a bailiff or policeman or woman and something we have to broker with the existing system is access to prisons for those we have found in need of incarceration.  In other words a prison sentence.  Therefore we don’t see why we shouldn’t have access as we are creditors of the public services we have and that is something we have to look into. 

At the moment, with the level of enforcement certainly has to be addressed and developed.

Enforcement is enforcing whatever has been upheld by orders in our case lawful orders upheld by community law courts trial by jury.

We have to have class actions happening across the British Isles to bring in the military to take out  those people that don’t allow us to enforce and uphold our rules by the will of the people.  However we are not suggesting there is isn’t work to be done but that is what has to be done.
