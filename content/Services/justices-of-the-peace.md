As [donations](https://communitylawcourts.org/donations/) come in for our [Community Law Courts](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/community-law-courts/), the aim is for us to have at least ten Justices Of The Peace in every town working full time and at least twenty-six in cities.  Justices Of The Peace telephone number to call will be ‘133’ .

Justices Of The Peace come from Statute Of Northampton 1328 and of the constitutional act of Justices Of The Peace act of 1361.  Therefore these two pieces of legislation we believe are the basis of keeping the peace in all communities and cities.  Justices Of The Peace role are there to stop any man or woman carrying weapons, breach of the peace or wearing armour.  They will always look into and investigate any breach of the peace, seek to intervene in the breach of the peace and they have the right to disarm any man or woman from carrying of any weapons.  

Justices Of The Peace have the power of arrest, power to imprison any man or woman who causes any harm, loss or injury in the community until they have the opportunity to be put before a trial by jury.  Justices Of The Peace will have the power to take a surety from a man and or from a woman whom have caused harm, loss or injury after a trial by jury at our [Community Law Courts](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/community-law-courts/).  The aim is for Justices Of The Peace to be set up quickly and for us to have the level of [donations](https://communitylawcourts.org/donations/) required to take some of these men and women who at present work for corporations and bring them into the community as Justices Of The Peace.

Men and women who would be suitable as Justices Of The Peace have to be either wise who have a great deal of knowledge and life experience that can de-escalate situations where a breach of the peace could or is occurring along with those who have skills in martial arts or similar.  Perhaps  young physically fit men and women who would not be advised to wear any weapons that could handle a situation where their lives could be in danger.  As a result, we have to have that mixture of people.  We would work in teams where we would have one wise man or woman with one man or woman who had more physical skills where they would work together. 

Men and women with some levels of disability like being confined to a wheelchair, would be able to work with a man or woman with physical fitness when they have wisdom and life experience.  For the wise man or woman would have to be trained in conflict resolution.

With regards to the [Community Law Courts](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/community-law-courts/), we can be at any location on the British Isles.  We merely ask our shareholders to [contact](https://communitylawcourts.org/contact/) us and let us know that they require us to make a class action claim.

Our aim at the [Community Law Courts](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/community-law-courts/) is to have [donations](https://communitylawcourts.org/donations/) come in so that we can compensate JOP for their work.  As we have our first JOP, our courts have been in process and we are making claims.  This is a fully functioning  cooperative and it will keep growing.

Justices Of The Peace will work in pairs and within groups of ten at a town or twenty-six at a city, would have knowledge of each other.  Initially JOP would work on foot.  Later it would be great for them to use cars or bicycles.

At the moment, we have Magistrates known too as Justices Of The Peace (JOP) who merely serve on a bench and enforce legislation at Magistrates' Courts.  Normally Magistrates are misinformed of what is true and policy enforcement officers pose as public servants.  They are not public servants because they only have corporate interests at heart and monetise the people through criminalising them.  They are also committing crimes because carrying weapons and wearing armour is a breach of the peace under the Justices Of The Peace Act 1361 and of the Statute Of Northampton 1328.  Police have been required to disarm as they are not part of the military.  They are civilians and they have refused to disarm.  Therefore, all we can do is to set up an alternative and ensure that people give their support, their [donations](https://communitylawcourts.org/donations/) to that in preference to what we have now.  

Justices Of The Peace are there to only uphold the peace of the people, prevent any breaches and to disarm any man or woman carrying weapons and wearing armour.
