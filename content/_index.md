[**Lawful advocacy**](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/lawful-advocacy/) is a new term that the [Community Law Courts](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/community-law-courts/) coined.  For us the definition of [lawful advocacy](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/lawful-advocacy/) is the capacity to have knowledge of both legalese system and of the lawful system and to have the skills an aptitude to operate between the two jurisdictions and be able to respond to both of those jurisdictions according to the facts of any particular claim.

For the [**Community Law Courts**](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/community-law-courts/) is natural law.  How we comprehend it is the law of now time because the law is created by the trial by jury.  For there are no judges in our court.  There is a judicator.  Someone like ourselves who can assist a trial by jury to comprehend things members of the trial by jury may be struggling with.  For a trial by jury make all of the decisions and they uphold the orders put forward by the claimant or not.

[**Justices Of The Peace**](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/justices-of-the-peace/) come from Statute Of Northampton 1328 and of the constitutional act of [Justices Of The Peace](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/justices-of-the-peace/) act of 1361.  Therefore these two pieces of legislation we believe are the basis of keeping the peace in all communities and cities.  [Justices Of The Peace](https://communitylawcourts.org/services/justices-of-the-peace/) role are there to stop any man or woman carrying weapons, breach of the peace or wearing armour.  They will always look into and investigate any breach of the peace, seek to intervene in the breach of the peace and they have the right to disarm any man or woman from carrying of any weapons.
