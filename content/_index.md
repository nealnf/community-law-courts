**Lawful advocacy** is a new term that the community law courts coined.  For us the definition of lawful advocacy is the capacity to have knowledge of both legalese system and of the lawful system and to have the skills an aptitude to operate between the two jurisdictions and be able to respond to both of those jurisdictions according to the facts of any particular claim.

For the **community law courts** is natural law.  How we comprehend it is the law of now time because the law is created by the trial by jury.  For there are no judges in our court.  There is no judicator.  Someone like ourselves who can assist a trial by jury to comprehend things they may be struggling with.  For a trial by jury make all of the decisions and for the trial by jury uphold the orders put forward by the claimant or not.
